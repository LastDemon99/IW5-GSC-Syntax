# IW5 GSC Syntax
This project aims to support GSC scripting syntax and autocomplete for IW5

This extension is a fork of the CoD-Sense extension, with many more features, highlights and autocomplete focused on iw5.

***This extension is under development***

The project is in development, since I don't have time, the autocompletes, like functions, fields, notifies, etc. They have been added automatically by script from raw files. There is no manual check, please note possible inconsistencies.

Optimization is also necessary for autocomplete, I currently don't have filters or triggers, just a simple huge CompletionItem[] :)
