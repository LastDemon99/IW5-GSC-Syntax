# IW5 GSC Syntax
> **Note**: **This extension is currently under development**. Due to limited time, the autocompletes, functions, fields, notifies, etc., have been generated automatically by a script from raw files. There has been no manual verification, so please be aware of potential inconsistencies.

This extension is a fork of the CoD-Sense extension, with gsc syntax highlight and numerous additional features for IW5 and the Plutonium environment. The Features will only work in files located in the scripts path: **%localappdata%/plutonium/storage/iw5**

You can find this extension in the Visual Studio Code marketplace: [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LastDemon99.lb-iw5-gsc)
