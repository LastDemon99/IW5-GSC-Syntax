# IW5 GSC Syntax
> **This extension is under development**, as I don't have much time. The autocompletes, functions, fields, notifies, etc., have been added automatically by a script from raw files. There has been no manual check, so please note possible inconsistencies.


This extension is a fork of the CoD-Sense extension, with many more features focused on IW5 and plutonium enviorement.

## Changelog

### 1.5.2:

- **Function Renaming**: Easily rename functions with F2.
- **Go to Definition**: Quickly navigate to function declarations with ctrl + click.

## Future Updates

In future updates, I plan to implement the following improvements:

- **Autocomplete Enhancements**: Autocomplete items are expected to be added, removed, and corrected to improve accuracy and usability.
- **New Features**: Add functionalities at the function scope, such as autocompletion, go to definition, and renaming of variables.
- **Function Documentation**: Read and display docstrings from files to show arguments and descriptions of functions, enhancing code understanding.

> **Note**: These features are planned for the next version. While they shouldn't be too complicated to implement, they were not included in the current release due to time constraints. Please note that the upcoming update will not be released immediately. In the meantime, feel free to leave any issues or suggestions in this repository.
