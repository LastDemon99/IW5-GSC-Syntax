Name: PhysicsJolt
Function: PhysicsJolt( <center>, <outer radius>, <inner radius>, <force> )
Module: Physics
Summary: Imparts a 1-frame randomly-jittered impulse on physics objects in a radius.
Example: PhysicsJolt( origin, 200, 150, (0.01, 0.01, 0.2) );
RequiredArgs:
1 : <center> The world position of the center of the cylinder
2 : <outer radius> The radius beyond which the force is zero
3 : <inner radius> The radius within which the force is maximum
4 : <force> A vector giving the direction and magnitude of the force of the explosion
