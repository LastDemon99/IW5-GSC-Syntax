Name: PhysicsJitter
Function: PhysicsJitter( <center>, <outer radius>, <inner radius>, <min displacement>, <max displacement> )
Module: Physics
Summary: Jitters physics objects touching the ground.  Jitter forces are calculated in such a way as to displace the object upwards some height between min and max displacement at each point of contact with the ground.
Example: PhysicsJitter( origin, 200, 150, 1.0, 5.0 );
RequiredArgs:
1 : <center> The world position of the center of the cylinder
2 : <outer radius> The radius beyond which the displacement is zero
3 : <inner radius> The radius within which the displacement is maximum
4 : <min displacement> Approximate minimum distance each contact point will be displaced
5 : <max displacement> Approximate maximum distance each contact point will be displaced
